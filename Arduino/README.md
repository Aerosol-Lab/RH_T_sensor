# Arduino

Connect your Arduino board to the computer. Then, open the Arduion_IDE software and open the code "RH-sensor.ino". Modify this code according to your needs. Subsequently, install the library [DHTLib](https://playground.arduino.cc/Main/DHTLib/). Here you can either download the "DHTlib.zip" provided here or download it from  https://playground.arduino.cc/Main/DHTLib/. To install this library go to "Sketch" then "Include Library" and then click on "Add .ZIP library..." and select the file "DHTlib.zip".


After DHTLib library is installed, upload this code to your Arduino board. Here, you may open the serial monitor to verify that data is being acquired.

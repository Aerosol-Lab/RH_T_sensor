# Python
We use Python to read the serial monitor and save the data to files for future post-processing.

Install the code by running:
	
    make
	
It will create a virtual environment called venv. Activate the venv by running:

    source venv/bin/activate

For Jupyter Notebook users just run:

    jupyter notebook

Then navigate to the Examples folder and run the codes.
